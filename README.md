"Completing my final capstone project, 'Periodic Tables,' within Thinkful's online Software Engineering program was a culmination of my acquired skills. This full-stack web application is designed to support restaurant management by facilitating reservation booking, seating arrangements, editing, and searching. The project enabled me to integrate a range of skills learned throughout my studies, focusing on creating a functional and visually appealing program with clean, efficient, and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.

I adopted a comprehensive approach to development, implementing eight user features through a combination of inside-out and outside-in Test-Driven Development (TDD). Each user story was treated as an individual branch before merging, ensuring systematic version control. The development process involved rigorous front-end and back-end testing, meticulous error-handling, and the implementation of routes and middleware.

Database management was a key aspect, and I utilized Knex to set up the database, executed migrations, and appropriately seeded it. Additionally, the application is deployed on Render, allowing others to easily view and test it. The inclusion of the 'cors' (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) feature in the backend further enhances the project's functionality.

Feel free to explore the deployed server and client on Render to experience the application firsthand!"
